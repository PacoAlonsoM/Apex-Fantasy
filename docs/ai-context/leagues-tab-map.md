# Leagues Tab Architecture Map

> Reference for AI work on `src/features/community/CommunityPage.jsx` and `src/features/standings/StandingsPage.jsx`.
> Last updated: 2026-04-21.

---

## 1. Route / Page Scope

| Route | Page component | File |
|---|---|---|
| `/leagues` (slug-based) | `CommunityPage` | `src/features/community/CommunityPage.jsx` |
| — | `StandingsPage` (embedded as `<StandingsPage compact />`) | `src/features/standings/StandingsPage.jsx` |

`CommunityPage` is the single file that owns the Leagues tab, Global Leaderboard, and F1 Standings tabs. All three are rendered inside the same component by switching `tab` state.

---

## 2. Top-Level Tab Structure

State: `const [tab, setTab] = useState("leagues")`

| `tab` value | Label | What renders |
|---|---|---|
| `"leagues"` | Leagues | League rail + in-league content panel (see §3) |
| `"leaderboard"` | Global Leaderboard | Full-width ranked list of all players |
| `"standings"` | F1 Standings | `<StandingsPage compact />` embedded inline |

Tab pill bar is rendered at the top of the content area, inside `CommunityPage`'s main `<main>` block.

---

## 3. Leagues Tab — In-League Sub-Tab Structure

State: `const [leagueView, setLeagueView] = useState("standings")`

The Leagues tab has a **two-column layout** at laptop width (CSS `@media(min-width:920px)` on `.stnt-leagues-section`):
- **Left rail** — league list (Pro featured card + user leagues + create/join actions)
- **Right content panel** — league header card + sub-tab pill strip + sub-tab view

| `leagueView` value | Label | Component | Extracted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"standings"` | Standings | `<LeagueStandingsView>` | Yes (component, ~line 427) |
| `"review"` | Round Review | `<LeagueReviewView>` | Yes (component, ~line 520) |
| `"chat"` | Chat | `<LeagueChatView>` | Yes (component, ~line 680) |
| `"setup"` | Rules | `<LeagueSetupView>` | Yes (component, ~line 850) |

---

## 4. Section-by-Section Detail

### 4.1 Leagues Tab — Left Rail

**Purpose:** League selector. Shows Pro board (always first), then user's private leagues, then create/join actions.

**Renders when:** `tab === "leagues" && user` (logged-in path)

**Key UI elements:**
- Pro league featured card (gold ring, `type === "pro_community"` badge)
- List of private leagues (mapped from `leagues` state)
- "Create league" button → opens `CreateLeagueModal`
- Join-by-code input + button

**State consumed:** `leagues`, `selectedLeagueId`, `visibleProLeague`, `joinCode`
**Callbacks:** `setSelectedLeagueId`, `setJoinCode`, `joinLeague`, `setShowCreateModal`

---

### 4.2 Leagues Tab — League Header Card

**Purpose:** Shows the selected league's name, type badge, member stats, sprint multiplier, prize grid (Pro only), and sub-tab pills.

**State consumed:** `currentLeague`, `currentStandings`, `leagueSummary`, `leagueView`, `isProUser`, `user`
**Callbacks:** `setLeagueView`, `deleteLeague`, `leaveLeague`

---

### 4.3 LeagueStandingsView

**File location:** top of `CommunityPage.jsx`, before `LeagueChatView`
**Renders when:** `leagueView === "standings"`

**Props:**
```js
{ currentLeague, currentStandings, leagueStandings, leagueSummary, isMobile, isTablet }
```

**Key UI elements:**

- Gap chip (right side of header, only when `leagueSummary.gap > 0`)
- Column headers: # / Player / Pts
- Standings rows: rank color (gold/silver/bronze), AvatarChip, username, gap sub-label, points
- Scroll container: `maxHeight: isTablet ? 640 : 720, overflowY: "auto"`
- Loading / empty states

**Data sources:** `leagueStandings[currentLeague.id]` fetched by `fetchLeagueStandings(id)` on `selectedLeagueId` change

---

### 4.4 LeagueReviewView

**File location:** top of `CommunityPage.jsx`, after `LeagueStandingsView`
**Renders when:** `leagueView === "review"`

**Props:**
```js
{
  currentLeague, currentLeagueReview, currentLeagueRoundResult,
  selectedLeagueRoundMeta, scoredRounds, leagueReviewRound,
  setLeagueReviewRound, isMobile, isTablet
}
```

**Key UI elements:**
- Card header: round title + round-selector pill strip (`stnt-vtab-strip`)
- Result facts row: Winner / Pole / DOTD / Constructor chips (4-grid, 2-col on mobile)
- Per-member review cards (2-col grid on desktop, 1-col on tablet):
  - Rank + AvatarChip + username + season points
  - Round score + correct-call count
  - "Scored hits" chip list (green = race hits, blue = Perfect Podium bonus)
  - Race board table: Label / Pick / Result / ±pts (2-col on mobile, 4-col on desktop)
  - Sprint board table (same pattern, only rendered when `entry.sprintRows.length > 0`)
  - "Saved {timestamp}" footer
- Loading / empty / error states

**Data sources:**
- `scoredRounds` — from `fetchScoredRounds()` on mount
- `leagueRoundReviews["{leagueId}:{round}"]` — from `fetchLeagueRoundReview(leagueId, round, members)`
- `currentLeagueRoundResult` — derived from `leagueRoundReviews` or `scoredRounds`

**Key derived values:**
```js
const currentLeagueReviewKey = `${currentLeague.id}:${leagueReviewRound}`;
const currentLeagueReview    = leagueRoundReviews[currentLeagueReviewKey];
const currentLeagueRoundResult = currentLeagueReview?.resultRow
  || scoredRounds.find(r => Number(r.race_round) === Number(leagueReviewRound));
```

---

### 4.5 LeagueChatView

**File location:** ~line 680 in `CommunityPage.jsx`
**Renders when:** `leagueView === "chat"`

**Props:**
```js
{
  items, user, isMobile, authorProfiles, currentLeague,
  canPost, leagueMessage, setLeagueMessage, onSubmit,
  forumReady, setPage, openAuth
}
```

**Key UI elements:**
- Chat header: live dot + "Pro Race Room" / "League Chat" + Pro badge
- Message composer (textarea + "Send ↑" button) — only when `canPost`
- Viewing-only banner: "Read-only" (Pro board) or "Log in to reply" (not logged in)

  - Others: left-aligned, neutral bubble, author chip left, author name above message

**State consumed:** `leaguePosts[currentLeague.id]`, `canPostInCurrentLeague`, `leagueForumReady[currentLeague.id]`
**Callbacks:** `setLeagueMessage`, `submitLeaguePost`

**Feature gate:** `canPostInCurrentLeague = Boolean(user && (!isViewingProLeague || (isProUser && !!proLeague?.id)))`

---

### 4.6 LeagueSetupView (Rules)

**File location:** ~line 850 in `CommunityPage.jsx`
**Renders when:** `leagueView === "setup"`

**Props:**
```js
{
  currentLeague, currentLeagueScoring, currentLeagueTiebreakers,
  currentLeagueSprintMultiplier, currentLeagueDoublePointsRaces,
  isMobile, isTablet
}
```

**Key UI elements:**
- 3-tile top row: Format / Access / Sprint multiplier
- Scoring board: 4-col grid of scoring tiles (alternating orange/blue tones), each shows label + big pts number
  - Sprint multiplier badge + double-points-rounds badge in header
- Tiebreaker ladder: numbered list with blue chips

**Data sources:** Derived from `currentLeague.settings` in `CommunityPage`:
```js
const currentLeagueScoring       = { ...DEFAULT_LEAGUE_SETTINGS.scoring_weights, ...settings.scoring_weights };
const currentLeagueTiebreakers   = settings.tiebreaker_order || DEFAULT_LEAGUE_SETTINGS.tiebreaker_order;
const currentLeagueSprintMultiplier = Number(settings.sprint_multiplier ?? ...);

```

---

- Column headers: # / Player / Pts
- Rows (stnt-stagger): rank color, AvatarChip, username, sub-label, points
  - Own row: orange highlight + `outline: 1px solid hexToRgba(ACCENT, 0.18)`
  - Top-3: taller padding (14px), larger avatar (36px), larger rank/pts numbers
  - Sub-labels: "Season leader" / "Podium pace" / "Prize bracket" / "Active player" / "You"

**State consumed:** `leaderboard`, `loadingLB`, `user`
**Data source:** `fetchPublicCommunity()` on mount — queries `profiles` table ordered by `points`

---

### 4.8 F1 Standings Tab

**Renders when:** `tab === "standings"`

**What renders:** `<StandingsPage compact />` — fully delegates to the standalone StandingsPage component.

**StandingsPage file:** `src/features/standings/StandingsPage.jsx`
- Has its own `useViewport()` hook and sub-components (`StatCard`, `DriversTable`, `ConstructorsTable`)
- `compact` prop removes the PageHeader so it embeds cleanly inside Leagues page layout
- Drivers / Constructors sub-tab managed internally

---

**Renders when:** `tab === "leagues" && !user`

**Key UI elements:**
- Hero: Hero-Main.png background with gradient overlay

- League name + description + Login / Join Pro / Open Global Leaderboard buttons
- Preview standings table: top real Pro members when the `pro_community` league has members

**Fallback league:** `FALLBACK_PRO_LEAGUE` (used when Supabase `pro_community` row hasn't loaded yet)

---

### 4.10 CreateLeagueModal

**Triggers:** "Create league" button in the left rail
**Renders via:** `createPortal(…, document.body)` — portal modal, not in main flow

**Steps (managed by `createStep` state):**
- Step 0: League name + visibility
- Step 1: Game mode selection
- Step 2: Scoring weights
- Step 3: Tiebreaker order
- Step 4: Extra categories + submit

**State consumed:** All the `league*` form states + `createError`, `createStep`
**Callbacks:** `createLeague`, `setShowCreateModal`

## 7. Data Sources

| Data | Supabase table(s) | Fetch function | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global leaderboard | `profiles` | `fetchPublicCommunity` | Mount |
| Scored rounds | `race_results` | `fetchScoredRounds` | Mount |
| Pro league row | `leagues` where `type = pro_community` | `fetchProLeague` | Mount |
| User's leagues | `league_members` → `leagues` | `fetchLeagues` | `user` change |
| League standings | `league_members` → `profiles` | `fetchLeagueStandings(id)` | `selectedLeagueId` change |
| Chat posts | `posts` where `league_id` | `fetchLeaguePosts(id)` | `selectedLeagueId` change |
| Round review | `predictions` + `race_results` | `fetchLeagueRoundReview(id, round, members)` | `leagueReviewRound` or `currentLeague` change |
| Author profiles | `profiles` where `id IN (...)` | `hydrateAuthorProfiles(posts)` | After chat posts load |

---

## 8. Key Interactions

| Action | Handler | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Click league in rail | `setSelectedLeagueId(id)` | Loads standings + posts for new league |
| Click sub-tab pill | `setLeagueView(value)` | Switches content area view |
| Click round pill in review | `setLeagueReviewRound(round)` | Triggers round review fetch if not cached |
| Send chat message | `submitLeaguePost()` | POST to `posts`, re-fetches posts |
| Create league | `createLeague()` → modal multi-step | Inserts to `leagues` + `league_members`, re-fetches |
| Join by code | `joinLeague(code)` | Upsert to `league_members`, re-fetches |
| Leave league | `leaveLeague(id)` | Delete from `league_members`, re-fetches |
| Delete league | `deleteLeague(id)` | Deletes from `leagues`, removes from local state |

## 9. Design Problems / Old Layers to Clean Up

### Banned patterns present
- None currently known in Leagues tab (cleaned up in 2026-04 redesign pass)

### Structural issues
- `AvatarChip` and `StatCard` are defined locally in both `CommunityPage.jsx` and `StandingsPage.jsx` — candidate for extraction to `src/ui/AvatarChip.jsx` and `src/ui/StatCard.jsx`
- `hexToRgba` is defined locally in both files — should be in `src/lib/colorUtils.js`
- `formatStamp` is local to `CommunityPage.jsx` — should be in `src/lib/textUtils.js`

### Content issues
- `LEAGUE_EXTRA_CATEGORY_LABELS` and `extraCategories` are wired to the Create modal but not surfaced anywhere in the Rules view — the feature exists in the form but has no review/display path
- Double-points rounds (`currentLeagueDoublePointsRaces`) are shown as a count badge but not listed round-by-round

### Mock data coupling
- Resolved in 2026-05 cleanup: Pro league standings/posts now use only Supabase rows. Mock profile fallbacks were removed.

---

## 10. What Should Be Removed / Merged / Redesigned (Future Work)

| Item | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Local `AvatarChip` in both files | Extract to `src/ui/AvatarChip.jsx` | Duplicated logic, drift risk |
| Local `StatCard` in both files | Extract to `src/ui/StatCard.jsx` | Same component, different files |
| Local `hexToRgba` in both files | Move to `src/lib/colorUtils.js` | Design-system utility, should be shared |
| Local `formatStamp` | Move to `src/lib/textUtils.js` | Text utility, reused across features |
| `leagueView === "setup"` label | Rename tab label from "Rules" to "Setup" or keep "Rules" | "Setup" is the internal key but "Rules" is what users see — verify intent |
| Create modal step 4 (extra categories) | Wire display into `LeagueSetupView` | Feature exists in form but has no display |
| `PANEL_BG_STRONG` alias | Remove on contact | Dead alias — identical to `PANEL_BG` |
| Logged-out preview | Consider standalone `<LeaguePreviewCard>` component | Currently 60+ lines inline in main component |
